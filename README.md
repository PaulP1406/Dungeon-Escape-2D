# Dungeon-Escape-2D
# Dungeon Escape game project

The game is built using plain Java and external libraries. It focuses on the story of a Prisoner who has to escape a dungeon with ghost chasing him through out the map, by collecting skulls and chest objects around the map. In order to beat the game, you can pick up powerups such as extra hp and speed up boots that are randomly placed in the map.

# Build and run instructions:

1. Pull the repo down to your local machine with git pull (SSH key or HTTP link)
2. Open the repo folder in your code editor
3. Compile the code via main.java class, or hit run while selecting the folder src/main/java in VScode and Eclipse
4. Alternate step: you can compile using the JAR file instead of running from main. The JAR can be found in the GameJAR directory!
5. Enjoy the game! and try to beat it:)

# Testing instructions:

1. Assuming you have already done the build and run instructions, open the repo in Eclipse IDE for Java
2. Double click on the folder, src/test/java
3. Once you see the folder tree opened, click once on Game.Dungeon (this package contain AppTest.java, which will run all the test cases)
4. If you wanted to see the test coverage, right click on Game.Dungeon package -> Coverage as -> JUnit Test
